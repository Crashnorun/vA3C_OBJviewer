vA3C OBJ Viewer
===
vA3C is an open source, 3D model viewer for AEC models that uses THREE.js to render 3D geometry in the browser. vA3C allows authors in the AEC industry to easily publish their 3D design work on the web, for free.


This fork is dedicated to opening OBJ / MTL files - especially those generated using photogrammetry.  This is being developed as a project that can easily be forked by participants of the Facades Plus Photogrammetry workshop in NYC, Spring 2015.  The goal is to provide an easy way to publish full color photogrammetry models on the web, for free.
